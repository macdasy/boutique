                “Upon graduating and amidst the period of Covid second wave, I woke up one morning realizing that I
                need to put my creativity and knowledge to use.  During my final semester of my college, I had come
                across a reel on instagram of a that showcased the process of eco-printing on fabric so beautifully. 
                That truly mesmerized me and popped my senses up to dig deeper into the world of natural colours and
                prints.  I researched, explored and experimented harder every single day for about 9 months to master
                the skill of natural dyeing. 
                Although, natural dyeing is quite a large and wide concept that cannot be mastered within months or
                few years for that matter.  This skill requires learning and exploration throughout your life. 
                My very first experiment of natural dyeing was a mere failure.  And so was my second, and my third and
                my fourth one too and so on…. .  After a number of unceasing errors and failures, I slowly started to
                progress and achieve good results in dyeing. <br/> <div style={{paddingTop:'2%'}} />

                        Each of our pieces is hand-crafted and made with lots of love and care.  We request you to look after the
                        product with utmost care.  All our pieces are cured and set to avoid colour bleeding and fading.  The right
                        care is necessary to maintain the longevity of handcrafted pieces. 
                        Since we work with botanicals that are a part of nature, some imperfections of dye or print is bound to
                        occur that still adds beauty to the product. <br/> <div style={{paddingTop:'2%'}} />

                            <li> Hand wash naturally dyed clothes separately in cold water or luke warm water only.  </li>
                            <li> Use a pH neutral detergent to wash your clothes.  GENTEEL is one such detergent available in the
                            indian markets that could be used to wash naturally dyed clothes.  </li>
                            <li> Do not dry under direct sunlight.  This will cause the product to fade.  Therefore, dry them only in
                            shade.  </li>
                            <li> Iron them on medium-low setting only.  Using the silk-mode setting on the iron machine could
                            also be used to iron silks.  </li>
                            <li> Keep them away from harsh chemicals such as vinegar, alcohol, iron etc. , This could cause
                            discolouration or change of colour of the product.  </li>
                        </ul>
